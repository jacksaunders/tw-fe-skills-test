# TrendWatching Front End Coding Challenge

## Installing the test

Install Node.js, Sass and Git on your machine. If you're a Windows user you'll also need to install Ruby.
Install Gulp using `npm install -g gulp.` You may need to use sudo in front of the Gulp install command to give it permissions.
Fork/Clone/Download this repository into your machine, you should hopefully see all the files and folders.
Open Terminal and install the dependencies using  `npm install`. You don't need sudo to do this.
Run `gulp` from the directory so start the build and browser-sync server.


## What is the test

The test is to build this dropdown as close as you can using HTML, SASS and JS

- The folder structure is there for you, all sass and js must go in the `src` folder - it will then be compiled into the `app` folder

- Any images fonts etc can go directly in the `app` folder

- Focus on getting the HTML and CSS completed with the dropdown visible underneath the "*add to project*" button.

- If you have time after that you can add a click to dropdown, jQuery is included in the source code

*Feel free to just use basic web standard fonts you will not lose points for not getting the right font in there*
